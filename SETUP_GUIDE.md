# Gallery & Testimonials Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Phase 1: Frontend Components
- ✅ Created `Testimonials.tsx` - displays client reviews with ratings
- ✅ Created `Gallery.tsx` - shows featured images in grid layout
- ✅ Created `GalleryModal.tsx` - full-screen lightbox with filtering
- ✅ Integrated components into main page

### Phase 2: Database Schema
- ✅ Created migration files in `supabase/migrations/`
- ✅ Defined tables: `gallery_images`, `testimonials`, `blog_posts`
- ✅ Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Configured storage buckets for images

## 🚀 Next Steps to Get Everything Working

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations

You need to apply the migrations to your Supabase database:

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of:
   - `supabase/migrations/20241204_create_cms_tables.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/20241204_create_storage_buckets.sql`
4. Run each migration

**Option B: Using Supabase CLI**
```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Generate TypeScript Types

After running migrations, generate types:

```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

Or manually in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Scroll to **TypeScript Types**
3. Copy the generated types
4. Paste into `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`

### Step 3: Add Sample Data (Optional)

To test the components, add some sample data:

```sql
-- Sample gallery images
INSERT INTO gallery_images (title, description, image_url, tags, is_featured, is_published)
VALUES 
  ('Modern Living Room', 'Contemporary design with minimalist aesthetics', 'https://example.com/image1.jpg', ARRAY['Residential', 'Living Room'], true, true),
  ('Luxury Kitchen', 'State-of-the-art kitchen design', 'https://example.com/image2.jpg', ARRAY['Residential', 'Kitchen'], true, true);

-- Sample testimonials
INSERT INTO testimonials (client_name, rating, review_text, project_type, is_published)
VALUES 
  ('John Doe', 5, 'Absolutely stunning work! The team transformed our space beyond our expectations.', 'Residential Renovation', true),
  ('Jane Smith', 5, 'Professional, creative, and delivered on time. Highly recommend!', 'Commercial Office', true);
```

### Step 4: Test the Components

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to your website
3. Scroll to the Gallery section (replaces old Portfolio)
4. Scroll to the Testimonials section
5. Click "View Full Gallery" to test the modal

## 📝 Current TypeScript Errors

The TypeScript errors you're seeing are **expected** and will be resolved after Step 2 (generating types):

- `Argument of type '"testimonials"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'`
- `Argument of type '"gallery_images"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'`

These occur because the Supabase client doesn't know about the new tables yet.

## 🎯 What's Next: Admin CMS (Phase 3)

After completing the above steps, we can build:
- Admin login page
- Dashboard for managing gallery images
- Interface for adding/editing testimonials
- Blog post editor

Let me know when you've completed the migration steps and we can continue!
